## Description

The user of this react application should be able to view the video response(s) of job candidates applying for a job at their company. The application should have the following workflow:

1. Choose candidate from a list.
2. Depending on the selection in the first step, if the selected candidate has an application, display the video response(s) of the candidate with the relevant question displayed in text. If the selected candidate does not have an application, display appropriate message.
3. For each video response of a candidate, provide an option to enter comments.
4. Provide a "Save" button that saves the comments to the api.json file.
